**Disclaimer:** This tool hasn't worked since 2023/2024 because Hi-Rez finally discovered basic security practices (after only 9 years!). Keeping this public as a monument to corporate incompetence.

## FAQ
Q: Can you update this to work again?
A: No smite isn't worth my time.

Q: Does this get me banned?
A: Hi-Rez's anti-cheat couldn't detect me making a sandwich in the game files. But no, it's obsolete.

Q: Why keep this public?
A: To remind everyone that Hi-Rez needed a decade to implement basic security.

## Legal Stuff (Because Hi-Rez Has Lawyers)
